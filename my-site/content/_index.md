Hi !

I'm Arthur Chan-Lock, a simulation ingeneer student.

I am a student at SeaTech Engineering School, currently seeking a 16-week engineering internship from June to August.

During the summer of 2024, I completed my first-year engineering internship at Decathlon, where I worked on logistics, managing product, customer, and staff flows. I also contributed to optimizing product sales using store sales data, and developed my interpersonal skills, particularly through extensive teamwork and communication with both staff and customers.

I have experience in several programming languages, including MATLAB, Python, C/C++, Fortran, and LaTeX. Additionally, I possess strong knowledge in pure mathematics, fluid mechanics, and continuum mechanics, which provide me with a solid foundation in mathematical and physical versatility, enabling me to learn new concepts quickly.

Furthermore, I have a deep passion for programming and simulation. Since middle school, I have been personally developing video games. I have created various games, such as a brick-breaker in C++, and collaborated with a friend on a more complex project using the Godot game engine.

I also completed an international mobility program in Canada at an English-speaking university, which helped me improve my English and learn how to socialize, work, and communicate while adapting to the frame of reference of people from unfamiliar cultures. As a result, I am able to work effectively and efficiently in teams with people of all backgrounds.
