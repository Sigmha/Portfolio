Hi!

I’m Arthur Chan-Lock, a simulation engineering student.

I am a SeaTech Engineering School student seeking a 16-week engineering internship from June to August.
During the summer of 2024, I completed my first-year engineering internship at Decathlon, where I worked on logistics and managed product, customer, and staff flows. I also contributed to optimizing product sales using store sales data and developed my interpersonal skills, particularly through extensive teamwork and communication with both staff and customers.

I have experience in several programming languages, including MATLAB, Python, C/C++, Fortran, and LaTeX. Additionally, I possess strong knowledge in pure mathematics, fluid mechanics, and simulation, which provide me with a solid foundation in mathematical, physical, and computational versatility and enable me to learn new concepts quickly.

Furthermore, I have a deep passion for programming. Since middle school, I have been developing video games on my own. I have created various games, such as a brick-breaker in C++, and collaborated with a friend on a more complex project using the Godot game engine.

I also completed an international mobility program in Canada at an English-speaking university, which helped me improve my English and learn how to socialize, work, and communicate while adapting to the frame of reference of people from unfamiliar cultures. As a result, I can work effectively and efficiently in teams with people of all backgrounds.
