Experiencing the thrill of riding a foil for everyone.

As a group of 10 students, we were working on a project given by Tuiva, a friendly water sports and innovative catamaran company. The main goal of this project is to make the catamaran “fly” above the water’s surface at a low speed by adding foils. And since the boat is intended for recreational use, it needs to be user-friendly for individuals without navigation experience.

I was mainly working on the numerical modeling section. My objective was to simulate the catamaran’s behavior with different foil setups to tell if it could theoretically rise above water or not. Since we had little time, I went to MatLab to make my simulation program. I made a 1-dimensional (a point) approximation of the ship and applied a finite differences method using explicit Euler.

Overall, this project taught me how to work as a team by relying on my coworkers, and daring to make decisions that can affect the whole project and, it obviously improved my modeling skills.

If you are interested, you can read our work below on this page but be aware that the whole document is in French. You can find an abstract in English on page 2. Then you can find my work on pages 14-16 and my code on pages 25-28.
