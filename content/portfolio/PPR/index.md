Here, I studied currents to forecast litter’s movement in oceans.

This was a research project I made during 2 years with the Mediterranean Institute of Oceanology laboratory in Toulon and was supervised by Yann Ourmières, a researcher.

This work is mainly bibliographical since I knew little about fluid mechanics and numerical simulation at the time, but I managed to learn a lot about those fields and this project actually made me choose to study simulation engineering.

Do not hesitate to check my work on the pdf below, but be aware that it is written in French. You can still find an abstract in English on page 20.
